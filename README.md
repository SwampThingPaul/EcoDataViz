# Ecology Data Viz (previously Ecology _#TidyTuesday_)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/192391693.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/192391693)

Much like [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), Eco-Data Viz is in the spirit of TidyTuesday focusing on working with ecological data in the R-environment with an emphassis on summarizing and displaying ecological data to a broader audience. All are welcome to join in the fun. This is an ever evolving repo, check back soon for new additions.

### 2019-06-18 (Iowa Lake Microcystin Concentration)

Q<sub>1</sub> Is the #cyanoHAB season starting earlier this year (2019) than the past 13 year period?
<br>
<br>

<center> Top seven highest observed historic #microcystin concentrations in Iowa. Looks like some are starting the season with a bang. #HABs.</center>
<br>
<br>

Q<sub>2</sub> Has peak microcystin concentrations shifted to earlier in the year over the 13-year period of record?
<br>
<br>

### 2019-06-25 (Greenland Surface Melt Extent)

1. Replicate [Greenland Daily Melt Plot](https://nsidc.org/greenland-today/)

<img src="./Plots/png/20190625_greenland.png" align="center" width = "70%"/>

<center>Calendar year 2019 Greenland surface melt extent relative to the 1979 to 2018 period of record.</center>

<br>
<br>
Q<sub>1</sub> Has the average trend in Greenland melt area increased?

<img src="./Plots/png/20190625_annualmean_greenland.png" align="center" width = "70%"/>

<center>Annual average Greenland melt area with 95% confidence interval for calendar year 1979 to 2018. The annual average has significantly increased over this period of record (Kendall Trend analysis: $\tau$ = 0.62; $\rho$ <0.01).</center>

<br>
<br>
Q<sub>2</sub> Has the peak melt area increased during the period of record?

<img src="./Plots/png/20190625_DOY_peak_greenland.png" align="center" width = "70%"/>

<center>Day of max melt area between calendar year 1979 to 2018. </center>
