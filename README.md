# Ecology Data Viz (previously Ecology _#TidyTuesday_)

Much like [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), Eco-Data Viz is in the spirit of TidyTuesday focusing on working with ecological data in the R-environment with an emphassis on summarizing and displaying ecological data to a broader audience. All are welcome to join in the fun.
