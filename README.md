[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/192391693.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/192391693)

Much like [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), Eco-Data Viz is in the spirit of TidyTuesday focusing on working with ecological data in the R-environment with an emphasis on summarizing and displaying ecological data to a broader audience. All are welcome to join in the fun. This is an ever evolving repo, check back soon for new additions.

### 2019-07-09 (Arctic Sea Ice Volume)

Using the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System ([PIOMAS](http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/projections-of-an-ice-diminished-arctic-ocean/)) data you can explore sea-ice thickness and volume changes throughout the years. Data used in this instance is located in the ["Data"](./Data/20190709/) folder.

<img src="./Plots/png/20190709_ArcticIce.png" align="center" width = "70%"/>

Daily changes in Arctic sea-ice volume and thickness over a 41 year period (1979 - 2019) using data from the Polar Science Center [PIOMAS Arctic Sea Ice Volume Reanalysis](http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/) project.

### 2019-09-17 (Arctic Sea Ice Extent)

Using data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder the National Snow and Ice Data Center can estimate sea-ice extent for both Arctic and Antarctic regions of interest. 

<img src="./Plots/png/20190917_ArcticSeaIce.png" align="center" width = "70%"/>

Daily changes in Arctic sea-ice extent for 2019 relative to the 1981 - 2010 period of record and the period of record minimum extent (2012) using data from the National Snow & Ice Data Center [ChArctic](https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/about-charctic-data/) program.

### 2019-09-28 (Southwest Florida Chill Hours)

Recently I started a project on our property (some progress [pics](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3QBgYkAXOz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)) to put in an apple orchard and native wildflower area. Being in Florida you typically don't think of apples being able to be grown here however a few apple cultivars can successfully be grown in Florida. These cultivars are known as [low-chill apples](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/mg368) and require what is known as chilling requirements or the amount of cold temperatures during a period of time. This is known as chill hours or the cumulative umber of hours less than 7<sup>o</sup> C. To understand the potential chill hours we experience in our garden I used data from three of the closest inland weather stations maintained by the South Florida Water Management District for the past 10-years, determined the annual chill hours and computed the upper 95% confidence interval. Based on this analysis we should be able to get enough chill hours to get an apple harvest from our trees once they are ready...assuming the climate doesn't get warmer.

<img src="./Plots/png/20190928_SWFloridaChillHours.png" align="center" width = "70%"/>

Annual (based on Florida water year; May to Apirl) chill hours for inland weather sites within South Florida maintained by the South Florida Water Management District. Data period of record covers May 2008 to Apirl 2019.

### 2019-12-09 (Lake Mendota Chlorophyll seasonality)

After seeing this twitter [post](https://twitter.com/hildug/status/1204059990241218560?s=20) by [Dr Hilary Dugan](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/) I got curious about the seasonality in chlorophyll-a concentrations within Lake Mendota. Chlorophyll-a concentrations can be used to assess the algal biomass within a given body of water. High chlorophyll-a concentrations can be indicative a an algal bloom. However, this metric does not indicate if it is a nuisance or Harmful Algal Bloom. 

<img src="./Plots/png/20191209_LakeMendotaChlorophyll.png" align="center" width = "70%"/>

Monthly chlorophyll-a concentration estimated by spectrophotometric (green dots) and fluorometric methods with seasonal locally weighted least squares with upper and lower 95% confidence intervals.
